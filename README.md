<h1>VBA Sync Tool&#x2001;<img src='http://i.imgur.com/sQAsBy4.png' alt='VBA Syc Tool logo' /></h1>

Synchronizes macros from an Office VBA-enabled file with a version-controlled folder. Can either dump modules from an Office file to a folder, or publish modules from a folder to an Office file.

This tool is superior to many other solutions because it…
  * …Does not add to your VBA code base.
  * …Does not require special Excel settings.
  * …Allows you to use any off-the-shelf version control system.
  * …Minimizes spurious changes by ignoring case on variable names, making merges easier.
  * …Extracts full code directly from the Office file, including several hidden attributes.
  * …Also extracts settings not tied to a particular module, like references.
  * …Generates FRX files compatible with the VBE, but *without* any embedded timestamp.
  * …Allows you to cherry-pick which modules to extract or publish.
  * …Allows you to extract or publish a FRM module without necessarily updating its FRX module.
  * …Works with document or worksheet modules in the same way as any other module.
  * …Supports Excel 97-2003, Excel 2007+, Word 97-2003, Word 2007+, PowerPoint 2007+, and Outlook files.
  * …Is completely free and open-source.
